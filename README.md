## Getting Started

Install browser js files:

    > bower install

Start a local server:

    > grunt server

Visit the site in your browser:

    http://127.0.0.1:9000/

## Development

Try editing app/index.html and you should see the livereload take
place.  This seemed to work in FF for me, but you might need Chrome
with the livereload plugin.
